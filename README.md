### Detailed Explanation of Each Step

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Forking a repository creates a personal copy of the repository under your GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

2. **Clone Your Fork:**
   - Cloning your forked repository to your local machine allows you to work on the code locally.
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LeetCode-Solutions.git
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

3. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Creating a new branch ensures that your changes are isolated from the main branch. This makes it easier to manage different features and fixes.
     ```sh
     cd LeetCode-Solutions
     git checkout -b feature-branch-name
     ```
   - Replace `feature-branch-name` with a descriptive name for your branch.

4. **Make Changes:**
   - Make the necessary changes to the code. This can include adding new features, fixing bugs, improving documentation, etc.

5. **Commit Changes:**
   - Staging (`git add .`) and committing (`git commit -m "Description of the changes you made"`) your changes prepares them for pushing to the remote repository.

6. **Push Changes:**
   - Pushing your changes uploads the new branch with your changes to your forked repository.
     ```sh
     git push origin feature-branch-name
     ```

7. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - A pull request (PR) is a request to merge your changes from your branch into the original repository's branch. Provide a detailed description to help the maintainers understand your changes and the reasoning behind them.
